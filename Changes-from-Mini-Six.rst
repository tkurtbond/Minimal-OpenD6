Changes from Mini Six
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

These are things that I think will improve the SRD.  Some of them are
corrections of things that I think are errors, other are things that I
think will improve the clarity of the writing or presentation.

Items with a check mark (✓) have been implemented.

• Do **not** Replace “OpenD6” with “``OpenD6``” because it refers to the
  name of an RPG system, not the title of a specific book.
• Make sure all sentences end with two spaces or a newline! (.?!)
  This ensures the proper inter-sentence spacing in “ms” output.
  Use Icon?
• In “Target Number (TN):” change “Intimidate” to “Persuasion”.
  (Intimidate is not listed in any of the skill lists.)
• Get rid of the commented out alternate table syntaxes?
• Daredevil: add “;” after however?
• ✓"Their” in “Game Master (GM)” should be “They are”.
• ✓Change “GM's” to “GMs”, except where they really are possessives.
• ✓Correct “it's” as a possessive to “its”.
• And the reverse: correct “its” as “it is” to “it's”.
• Check all the Static Defenses for the character templates.
• Check all the Static Defenses for the animals???
• Change internal headers in “Gear” from italic to bold, to make them
  easier to see?
• Add “Weapon” to column header for weapons in Gear??
• Rename Armor column to Armor Type, and Value to Armor Value?
  **Maybe, maybe not.**
• Make table headings consistent (bold vs. italic, etc.)
  The Gear table uses bold at the top header, but italic in the inner
  headers.  
• Make Spell attributes bold.  “TN” becomes “**TN**”.
• ✓Put “Gunslinger:” in bold in “No Attributes” example, like “Knight:"
  in “Independent Skills”.
• Put skill names before ratings in “No Attributes” example?
• ✓Fix hyphen-minus characters that should be minus sign characters.
• ✓Fix hyphen-minus characters that should be en dashes.
• ✓Change “fiat;” in §“The Wild Die” to “fiat:"
• Bold “Potency:”, “Scale:” “Might:”, “Agility:”, “Wit:”, “Charm:”,
  “Skills:”, “Perks:”, “Complication:”, “Spells:”, “Gear:”, “Static:"
  in example characters.
• ✓"Bestiary”, not “Beastiary"
• ✓Make sure shields and armor have space before parentheses around value,
  but **not** Soak 9(11).
• ✓Fix “at sunrise the next sunrise” in Phoenix.
• ✓"nite” to “night” in Vampire.
• ✓"(if any)” to “(if anything)” in “Alien Races (varies):"
• ✓Check that all “soak(av)” have no space before the parenthesis.
• ✓"Wound” to “Wounded” in “Razor-ImaAC”???
• ✓"Lt.” to “Light"
• ✓"Hvy” to “Heavy"
• ✓"2x” to “2×” or “200%” in §“Navigation Bonus”.  I'm leaning toward
  the latter for consistency.  Yes, “200%” for consistency.
• ✓In “Static Defenses” add Soak to the list of precalculations.
• ✓In “Why two rules?” change “resolution.  While” to “resolution, while”.
• ✓Traditional OpenD6 Combat > Defensive Options: change “parry's” to
  “parries”.
• ✓In “General (non-combat) Challenges” change “Average character” to
  “Average characters”.
• ✓In “Chases” capitalize “Long” in the last sentence, since it was
  capitalized in the list of ranges earlier in the paragraph.
• ✓In “Spells Requiring Multiple Actions” “Throw” should be “Throwing”.
• ✓Make sure all the skill names are used consistently.
  (Generalization of previous point.)
• ✓Italicize skill names to make them stand out?  Same for spell names?
  Mini Six italicizes the spell “Shape Change” in the section
  “Potions” when describing “A Potion of Changing”.  In the section
  “Other Items” the skills listed for two of the items are italicized.
  (RE: AD&D 1E PHB.)

  This is done in several places, but not in others (The “Target
  Number” definition mentions Seduce and Intimidate, but they are not
  italicized; in the Skills section “Brawling” is not italicized).  I
  think it should be done everywhere.

  Consider using :skill: and :spell: roles, if I
  can figure out how to get them to work with .docx and ODT output.

  What about attribute names?  Should they be indicated?  If so how:
  italics, bold?

  All of them should be capitalized, too.  For instance, in “A
  Mechanic's Work is Never Done” “repair roll” should probably be
  capitalized.

  But not when in bullet lists or tables of skill names.

  But not “Dodge” when referring to the score or action! (His Dodge
  score is 9.  He Dodges. He makes a *Dodge* roll.)
• Add metric versions of distances in parenthesis?  Or convert all
  distances to yards, and just say to use that number of meters if
  your group prefers metric.

  Over 100 meters that's 400 inches, which is (/ (/ (* 4 100) 12.0) (*
  12 100)) 0.02777777777777778, which is 2.7%.  Not a problem.
• In “Spell Books”, several times “spell” is used when “spell book” is
  probably meant.
• ✓In “The Simple Magic System” “let's” should be “lets”.
• ✓The “Fast Talk” used in “Ring of Slyness” and “Confidence Man”
  should be replaced with “Persuasion”, because “Fast Talk” is not a
  skill in any of the skill lists.
• ✓The “Chill Touch” description should probably not be italicized or
  end with a period.  Compare to the “Changeling"'s perk “Mimic”.
• ✓In “Reflexive Dodge:” “other TN, (Range and Cover still apply.)” the
  comma after “TN” should be a period.
• ✓"Rookie:” the skill names should be italicized.
• ✓In “The Kings of Hazard:” the word “sherriff” should be “sheriff”.
• ✓In “Splitting Dice:”, should +1 and +2 be quotes, like +3 is?  No,
  +3 is quoted because it's a value that isn't actually valid/used.
• ✓In “Definitions of Common Game Terms”, in “Target Number (TN):”, the
  skill Intimidate is mentioned, but that is not one of the listed
  skills.  Changed to “Persuasion”.
• ✓In “Skills” in the second paragraph “Brawling” should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Skill Specializations” “Running” and “Athletics” are skills and
  should be italicized.
• ✓In “Energy Blast (5):” “Throwing” is a skill and should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Telekinesis (3):” “Lift” is a skill and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Assisted Healing:” “Medicine” is a skill and should be
  italicized.
• In “Static Defenses” “their Dodge, Block, and Parry” should be
  “their Dodge, Block, Parry, and Soak scores” for clarity.
• ✓In “Static Defenses” “become's” should be “becomes”.
• ✓In “Static Defenses” “Sword” is a skill and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Static Defenses” “Brawling skill” refers to a skill and so
  “Brawling” should be italicized.
• ✓In “Static Defenses” “Dodge skill” refers to a skill and so
  “Dodge” should be italicized.
• ✓In “Traditional OpenD6 Combat”, “Attacking A Target”, “Range:”,
  “Dodge roll” refers to a skill roll, and so “Dodge” should be
  italicized.  Or maybe it refers to the Dodge action and should not?
• ✓In Traditional OpenD6 Combat, “Defensive Options”, “Full Dodge:”,
  “Roll dodge” refers to the skill and so “dodge” should be
  capitalized and italicized.
• ✓In “Ramming”, “Pilot” is a skill and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Multiple Weapons on Vehicles”, “Command” is a skill and should
  be italicized.
• ✓In “Casting Spells” “Magic” occurs as a skill name twice and should
  be italicized.
• ✓In “Spells Requiring Multiple Actions”, “Throw” is a skill name and
  should be italicized.  Since in the main rules the skill name is
  “Throwing”, in this section it should be “Throwing”, italicized.
• ✓In “Precinct '77”, “Skill List”, “Agility”, “Throw” is used as a
  skill name.  In the main rules, the skill name is “Throwing”.  It
  should be changed to “Throwing” here for consistency???

  No, ignore it, it's product identity and won't be included in release. 
• ✓In “Beginning Spells & Learning More”, “Magic” is a skill name and
  should be italicized.
• ✓In “Magic Perks”, “Magic” is a skill name and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Sorcerer's Tools”, in “The Cloak”, “The Crystal Ball”, “The
  Magic Wand”, and “The Spell Staff”, “Magic” is used as a skill name
  and should be italicized.
• In “Sorcerer's Tools”, “The Spell Staff”, for “to Magic” it should
  probably say “to any Magic skill test” for consistency with the
  earlier items.
• ✓In “Making Sorcerer's Tools”, “Magic” is a skill name and should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Invisibility”, “Stealth” is a skill name and should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Lighting Bolt”, “Throw” should be “Throwing”.
• ✓In “The Valiant Sword”, “Command” is a skill name and should be
  italicized.
• ✓In stat blocks, should skill names be italicized?  **No**, because in
  stat blocks you know they are skills, while in body text you may
  not. 
• ✓In “No Attributes”, “Brawl”, “Pistols” and “Rifles” should be
  “Brawling”, “Pistol” and “Rifle” for consistency.
• ✓In “No Attributes”,  “Pistols”, “Rifles”, “Toughness”, “Dodge”,
  “Brawl”, and “Gamble” are skills and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Traditional OpenD6 Hero Points”, “Security” is a skill name and
  should be italicized.
• ✓In “Traditional OpenD6 Might Damage”, “Lift” is a skill name and
  should be italicized.  (Occurs twice.)
• ✓In “What are the Skills?”, “Medicine” is a skill name and should be
  italicized???  I'm leaning towards not: by analogy with the other
  things mentioned, it is a subject, not a skill name in this case.
• ✓In “Bull in a China Shop:”, “Dodge” is a skill name and should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Navigation Bonus”, “Navigation” is a skill name and should be
  italicized. 
• ✓In “Brownie (4):”, “stealth” and “Dodge” are skill names and should
  be capitalized and italicized.
• ✓In “Hannedyn (2):”, “Stealth” and “Dodge” are skill names and should
  be italicized.
• ✓In “Small:”, “Stamina” is a skill name and should be italicized.
• ✓In “Tiny:”, “Stamina” is a skill name and should be italicized.
• ✓In “The Simple Magic System” change “let's” to “lets”.
• Make sure everything uses the Oxford comma?
• Make page breaks before the main headings?
• In “Target Number (TN):”, the wording of the first sentence is
  awkward.  Reword?
• ✓In “Damned Fool Hero:”, the parenthetical expression (except for the
  giving to the needy part.  A Hero's got to eat.) should probably not
  be part of the preceding sentence, so should be capitalized and the
  preceding comma should be a period.
• ✓Correct spelling of extiguisher, changling, paticular.
• Correct static defenses of Noble in Perdition: Dodge should be 12,
  Block should be 5, and Soak should be 5, alas.
