# Announcing Minimal OpenD6, an SRD for Mini Six

Anybody interested in an SRD for *Mini Six*? Since *Mini Six* is under
the Open Game License, I have created one for it, [Minimal
OpenD6](https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6).  (It does
**not** include the Product Identity portions, of course.)

If you just want to read the rules I still think the original [Mini
Six: Bare Bones
Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144558/Mini-Six-Bare-Bones-Edition)
is a great document, packing so much into a dense but readable layout,
so download it for free or get a print copy.  However, if you want a
custom version of the rules, whether you are producing a completely
new game or just want a version of the rules with all your house
rules incorporated, this should be a great starting point.

Why start with *Minimal OpenD6* instead of of *OpenD6*?  Because you
want to start with a minimal core and add things gradually, rather
than starting with a very large document and cutting out everything
you don't want!

*Minimal OpenD6* provides
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) source
for the document, as well as simple PDF, HTML, EPUB, Microsoft Word
`.docx`, and OpenOffice/LibreOffice `.odt` output.  Conversions to
other formats are possible using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or
other means.

If you just want the output files without any of the stuff used to
build them, look at the
[releases](https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6/releases) page
in the repository for a zip file.
