Announcing Minimal OpenD6, an SRD for Mini Six

Anybody interested in an SRD for [i]Mini Six[/i]? Since [i]Mini Six[/i] is under the Open Game License, I have created one for it, [url=https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6]Minimal OpenD6[/url]. (It does [b]not[/b] include the Product Identity portions, of course.)

If you just want to read the rules I still think the original [url=https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144558/Mini-Six-Bare-Bones-Edition]Mini Six: Bare Bones Edition[/url] is a great document, packing so much into a dense but readable layout, so download it for free or get a print copy. However, if you want a custom version of the rules, whether you are producing a completely new game or just want a version of the rules with all your house rules incorporated, this should be a great starting point.

Why start with [i]Minimal OpenD6[/i] instead of of [i]OpenD6[/i]? Because you want to start with a minimal core and add things gradually, rather than starting with a very large document and cutting out everything you don't want!  (Different approaches work better for different folks.)

[i]Minimal OpenD6[/i] provides [url=https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html]reStructuredText[/url] source for the document, as well as simple PDF, HTML, EPUB, Microsoft Word[u].docx[/u],  OpenOffice/LibreOffice [u].odt[/u], and Markdown output.  Conversions to other formats are possible using [url=https://pandoc.org/]pandoc[/url] or other means.

If you just want the output files without any of the stuff used to build them, look at the [url=https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6/releases]releases[/url] page in the repository for a zip file.
