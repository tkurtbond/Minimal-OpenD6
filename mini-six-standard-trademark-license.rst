About the Mini Six Standard Trademark License
=============================================

**Purpose:** Mini Six is a variant of the OpenD6 system and like it's
parent is licensed under the Open Game License (OGL). Within the terms
of that license anyone may use, reprint, modify, or translate Mini
Six. Your rights under the OGL are not discussed here. What the OGL in
Mini Six Bare Bones edition doesn't grant you the right to do is to
use the trademark "Mini Six" which is property of AntiPaladin
Games. The Mini Six Standard Trademark License (MSSTL) permits third
party publishers and creators the use of the Mini Six Trademark under
a few stipulations.

**Say What?** The system was published under the Open Game
License. That alone allows you to do all sorts of cool things with
Mini Six without our permission. What the OGL doesn't allow you to do
is to claim that your work is Mini Six compatible. The Mini Six
Standard Trademark License fixes that.

FAQ:
====

**Q:** Do I have to include the text of the Mini Six Standard Trademark
License in my work?

**A:** No.

**Q:** If I use the Mini Six Standard Trademark License and the Open
Game License, does that mean that I can reprint, modify, or make use of
everything contained in Mini Six Bare Bones Edition?

**A:** Almost. Neither the MSSTL nor the OGL grant the use of any
artwork or logos from the book, with the exception of the OpenD6 logo
which is property of West End Games / Purgatory Publishing. Use of the
OpenD6 logo is detailed in the OGL and is not an issue on which
AntiPaladin Games will give advice. Additionally, a few pages of
material have been reserved as Intellectual Property by AntiPaladin
Games, namely the short settings "Farnsley's Phantasm Investigations"
and "Precinct '77," so they may not be used or reprinted by you.

**Q:** Wait. What can I use if I take advantage of the MSSTL and the
OGL?

**A:** Everything except the artwork and logos (except for the OpenD6
logo, though to use that you must comply with the terms set forth in the
OGL), and the two mini settings "Farnsley's Phantasm Investigations" and
"Precinct '77."

**Q:** Didn't you just answer the same question twice?

**A:** Yes. We think that it's just that important.

**Q:** Do I have to use the OGL to use the Mini Six trademark?

**A:** Yes. To comply with the Mini Six Standard Trademark License you
must also comply with the Open Game License. If you fail to comply with
the OGL, then you also fail to comply with the MSSTL.

**Q:** I don't care about the Mini Six Trademark. Can I just use the
OGL?

**A:** Yes you may. But you may not refer to your work as Mini Six or as
Mini Six compatible, and may not otherwise use or refer to the Mini Six
trademark, except as needed in the Copyright Notice and Product
Identification sections of the Open Game License. (Which you must do.)

**Q:** Do you have a cool logo for people to use?

**A:** Not yet, but when we do we will update the Mini Six Standard
Trademark license to include it's use along with the trademark itself.

**Q:** Can you explain part 5 of the MSSTL to me?

**A:** Be cool. Don't represent your work as a new edition of Mini Six
or imply that your work is a non-variant or non-derived work. We'll be
cool too. We want you to use Mini Six! Things that we certainly won't
deny are titles such as "Mini Six: French Edition" or similar, for
translations, and other titles which make it clear to readers that there
is another book out there called Mini Six.

**Q:** Do I have to use the MSSTL if I just want to write about you on
my blog, in my magazine, etc?

**A:** No! Fair use allows you to write reviews and excerpt small
passagages without worrying about such things. Of related concern, the
OGL might come into play if you publish things covered by it, but unless
you're a real ass about it we don't care. The Mini Six Standard
Trademark License is intended for print and electronic publishers of
game materials.
